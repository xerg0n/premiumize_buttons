# premiumize_buttons
A userscript that adds some buttons for convinience.

- open the Premiumize_buttons.user.js file in raw mode
- confirm installation

## Usage

- open one of the files
- two buttons should have been added under the breadcrumps 
- the main page should now contain a 'reopen last' button
